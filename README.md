This is basically a game i am making for fun.
It's about the anime JoJo's bizarre adventure.
I'm very new to coding so yes pls no bully :pray:

looking back at this code after like a year and this code seems shitty. I might update this if i get the time but i dunt use python a lot anymore, i use c++ so maybe i can migrate to that?
